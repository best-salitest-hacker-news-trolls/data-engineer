Samsung wants the flexibility to price devices differently by region&#x2F;market and that doesn&#x27;t work if the consumer can import the cheapest one instead. This will probably continue to escalate because the way the market is heading prices have to get lower in expanding&#x2F;poorer markets while customers in established&#x2F;wealthier markets are willing to pay more. This is a side effect of trying to win the race to the bottom on price.

You hear advice about asking clarification questions, discussing trade-offs, etc. but at the end of the hour one of the most important things is the code you put up on that board.  The interviewer will likely whip out their phone, take a pic, and that&#x27;s that.<p>- Coding on a whiteboard, with a stranger, in an unfamiliar environment, after traveling many miles... is... challenging.

You then never hear back from the recruiter, or receive an email stating that they&#x27;re not moving forward.

I focus on the smaller aspects first and then move to larger architectural stuff once I understand it better. Google is my main tool, every single problem I encounter I google first before trying to invent a solution. This allows me to get a broad overview of what is available before moving into the territory where I need to create more heavily.<p>For instance once I was building a recipe search engine on a new platform in python, my process went like this:<p>1) Make 1 table in the database, for recipes, with the constraints that I needed. (Learned Model Representation)<p>2) Build a lame page which would pull a single recipe and show it. (Learned Basic View and Controller)<p>3) Build a page where I can type in a query and get some recipes back. (Learned how forms are handled)<p>4) Added way more DB Tables to cover most of the data schema. (Learned more advanced DB operations)<p>5) Built better looking Web pages which would be more responsive. (Caching, Static file handling, more advanced controllers)<p>6) Built actual search code<p>Although this is a specific example, I find using a method such as this, where I start with very basic problems of the larger picture, allows me to get moving very quickly. Furthermore, as I start knocking off the easier stuff I feel more confident and I learn the best places to find answers for my questions for that framework."

This kid (he's 30 can I call him a kid?) has ambition and what appears to be the drive to create his own OS - I mean, if you read the bottom of his page, he did some research (sure, wiki-ing them is not equal to actually understanding them), but it at least shows willingness to learn, and we should not be putting him down at all.<p>Sometimes the HN crowd surprises me. We pride ourselves in being hackers, most often idealistic (bitcoins and patent law change anyone?) but when a singular person shows idealistic ambition, we immediately engage in poppy cutting.<p>Sigh."

There are plenty of ways to be successful while being totally forthright and honest with your customers that you should never have to resort to tricks like this.  If I found out a vendor did this to me, I would never do business with them again.<p>When I was younger and more foolish, I once did something like to this.  I made 1000 perforated postcards to send to local businesses with a simple ""anonymous"" survey on the tear-off asking about their software.  Except the tear-offs were not anonymous at all.  Every single postcard had a slightly different return address.  By slightly altering the positioning of 6 different items and recording it in the data base, I had enough permutations to uniquely identify who returned the card.  I could then call on those who needed what I had.<p>I thought it was pretty slick until my partner refused to participate.  He said that my hack wasn't worth the hit to our reputation if anyone found out.  He also thought we should earn our business without any tricks and establish excellent relationships with our customers.<p>It took me a while, but I understood his lesson.  This hack seems eerily similar."
